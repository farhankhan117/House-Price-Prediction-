# 🏠 Linear Regression – House Price Prediction

## 🎯 Objective
Implement **simple and multiple linear regression** models to predict housing prices by exploring feature relationships and building an effective predictive model.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## 🔍 Summary of Steps
### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- Loaded the housing dataset
- Checked data structure and missing values

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**
- Prepared feature matrix and target variable

### 3. Train-Test Split
- Split the dataset into:
  - **80% Training**
  - **20% Testing**

### 4. Model Building
- Implemented:
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
- Trained models on the training dataset

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **R² Score**

### 6. Visualization & Interpretation
- Plotted regression lines for features against house prices
- Analyzed regression coefficients to understand feature impact

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Certain features have a strong positive impact on house prices
- Multiple linear regression improves prediction accuracy over simple regression
- Feature coefficients provide clear interpretability of the model

---

## ✅ Conclusion
A housing price prediction model was successfully developed using **multiple linear regression** with properly preprocessed data.  
Evaluation metrics show reasonable accuracy, and visualizations along with coefficient analysis offer meaningful insights into how different features influence house prices.
