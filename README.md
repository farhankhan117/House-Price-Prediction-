# Linear Regression - House Price Prediction

## Objective  
Implement simple and multiple linear regression to predict housing prices by exploring feature relationships and building a predictive model.

## Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Summary of Steps  
- Loaded and explored the housing dataset, checked for missing values  
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding  
- Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets  
- Built and trained linear regression models on training data  
- Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² metrics  
- Visualized regression lines for features against price  
- Interpreted coefficients to assess feature impact on price  

## Conclusion  
The housing price prediction model was developed using multiple linear regression with preprocessed and encoded data. Evaluation metrics demonstrated reasonable accuracy, and visualization along with coefficients provided insights into the effect of different features on house prices.
