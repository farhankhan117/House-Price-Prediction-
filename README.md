# Linear-Regression
Objective:
In this task, I implemented and understood simple and multiple linear regression using the House Price Prediction Dataset. The goal was to explore the relationships between the features and the target variable (price) using linear regression.

Tools and Libraries:
Python

Scikit-learn: Used for creating and training the linear regression model.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Matplotlib: For plotting regression lines and visualizations.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a House Price Prediction Dataset containing features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and more, with the target variable being price.

Steps Taken:
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset and performed initial analysis.

Checked for missing values and handled them (if needed).

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).

Linear Regression Model:

Applied simple linear regression for a single feature (e.g., area).

Applied multiple linear regression for multiple features (e.g., area, bedrooms, bathrooms).

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model performance using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

RÂ² (R-squared score)

Visualization:

Plotted the regression line for simple linear regression.

Visualized the relationships for multiple features in the model.
